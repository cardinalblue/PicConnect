👋🏻 **Introduce yourself:** Where are you from, how to pronounce your name, how would you like to be called?

</aside>

Hi! My name is "Roméo", it's an Italian name... but I'm French. It's pronounced "RRRRR-oméo". But the "R" sound can be a little hard to pronounce!

<aside>
💼 **Which Function and Efforts are you in?**

</aside>

I'll be working mainly with the Explore team as Project Marketer. But I'll also be helping out the PicCollage team from time to time. For the moment, my main missions will be to work on OnBeat and others videos app later!

💡 **What are / will you be working on?**

</aside>

In the end, it's quite broad: it could be Ads, AppStore optimization, influence, strategy for social media or content... Whatever it takes to get OnBeat off the ground as best we can! 🚀

<aside>
⛰️ **Who are you outside of work?** This could include things like your hobbies and interests

</aside>

I travel a lot and love trying out new restaurants around me! I also read a lot of books (mainly about politics/personal development/biography/Web3) and I love writing blog posts. I still have 11 blogs today about many topics (with a focus on travel but I've been writing them since I was 13). I love learning and teaching too! I'm lucky enough to be able to give university courses (online) to students in France and it's so cool! 

<aside>
💪🏻 **“You can lean on me to…”** List your strengths here! What can your teammates lean on you for?

</aside>

You can count on me to discuss all the latest news on technology or marketing (I spend far too much time looking at that...).

In the past I've also been able to work in a web agency / media agency and really focus on several subjects: Influence strategy, SEO, Social Media, Newsletter, Social Ads, Go-To-Market plans, content/website optimizations, etc.

And if you need any help, don't hesitate to contact me anytime! I think I'm also good at cheering you up if things aren't going too well!
