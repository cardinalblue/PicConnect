- **Fun Facts**

My favorite novel is Harry Potter, and I have read the whole series for over 95 times.

I just finished reading another book called “[**The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War**](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010903652)” during the CNY holiday. This book is the one that makes me feel on pins and needles the most!

I am better at making deep friends than making lots of friends.

I really don’t use hairspray…
