**Bio**

**Introduce yourself**

- Hello everyone! I’m Morgan, you can also call me Mor or Mo. I was born in Tainan. I moved to Taipei after college graduation. I currently live in Hsintzu so I commute everyday, which sounds scary but it’s fine.

**Which function and efforts are you in?**

- I’m working as a product designer on PicCollage effort.

**What are you currently working on?**

- I’m in the template search project with Katherine & Maggie, and also doing the store button experiment.

**Who are you outside of work?**

- I’m a night owl. I usually spend my nights drawing, writing, or watching Netflix, and none of those things are helpful for sleeping.
- I also do street dance and play badminton, please invite me and I will be happy to join!

**“You can lean on me to…”**

- I can be a good listener. I can also provide some suggestions but only when you want me to.
- Explore great food and coffee together!

**What are your hidden talents?**

- The only game I play is Tetris but I’m good at it. My best rank on [https://tetr.io/](https://tetr.io/) was around no. 500 (S level) in Taiwan.

**A “quirk” about you**

- I like to play sitcoms as background when I’m doing chores, so I remember most of the contents in [How I Met Your Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/).
