## Bio

**Introduce yourself**

- Hi there, this is Phoebe, I am from Taichung!  I’ll say I am an easy going person, feel free to chat with me when run into me in the office (I am there almost everyday XD)!

**Which function and efforts are you in?**

- Ops (People Ops)

**What are you currently working on?**

- Recruiting related tasks, events. Also applying for work permits. And of course, Weiya preparation

**Who are you outside of work?**

- I like outdoor activities! Hiking, biking, walking around in the city. But sometimes also like to stay at home and watch movie on NF or Disney +!

**“You can lean on me to…”**

- I am always here when the team needs me, just slack me and I will give you a hand. (small talks are also welcome)

**Fun Facts**

- My perfect day would start with a warm drink and end with a perfect sunset from our patio.
- I like Winter the most cause it’s rare in Taiwan.
- I love cooking & baking, love to spend my free time studying recipes (my favorite part: mixing Eastern & Western flavors and still tasting good )
- An accomplishment I’m particularly proud of is: Always able to discover Ubike 2.0 stops in Taipei/New Taipei  (now the number is still growing!!!)
