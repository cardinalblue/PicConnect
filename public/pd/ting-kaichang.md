## Bio

- **Introduce yourself**

Hi, I am Ting-Kai CHANG (庭愷). You can call me Ting-Kai or Kai.

I was born in Taipei. Studied in Kaohsiung, Taipei, and Boston.

- **Which function and efforts are you in?**

Developer in Front-end function (for web), work with Explore effort, so welcome any ideas about new products or web techs!

- **What are you currently working on?**

Currently, I work with the explore web team, we are doing tryouts, testing, and implementing some libraries and services, we are gonna figure out what options we have for future development.

- **Who are you outside of work?**

Outside my professionals, I am a lifetime observer . I don’t have really particular interests or hobbies, I enjoy observing daily surroundings more. I am willing to try any genre of music, different flavors of foods, or any type of performance I’ve never seen.

- **“You can lean on me to…”**

I am very patient and lazy . Friends say I am a good listener.

Always curious about details and happy to take care of them (if time allows).

**Fun Facts**

- I’m practically addicted to:
- I like to watch Formula 1  , not only the race itself but also the stories and strategies among teams and drivers. It’s very interesting to see how they put 100 million a year into a car.
- One thing I cannot live without:
- 麻油薑 Minced ginger in the sesame oil. It’s like the all-purpose spicy sauce for me, I love to add it to anything that is lack of flavor.
