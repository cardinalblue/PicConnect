- I like going to the gym mainly to maintain what muscle I have (I hate cardio though)
- I like listening to all sorts of music, but usually heavier stuff such as rock, hip-hop, metal, and electronic music. I’ve been really into electronic music lately and my favorite genres are breakbeat, drum-and-bass, ukg, or any kind of bass music. My favorite electronic artists include Justice, Fred Again.., The Chemical Brothers, Jamie XX, and so on. I’m currently learning to DJ in my spare time.
- I like playing basketball and watching the NBA, and I like watching football but can’t play it
- I used to be a big PC gamer. My favorite games include Team Fortress 2, The Fallout Series, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher 3, 2K, and any classic Lego game, but I mainly play Monster Hunter now
- I also like going out to drink with friends! My go-to order used to be Long Island but I’ve since become a lot more tame
