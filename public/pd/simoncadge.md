Hey everyone! I’m Simon and I’m from the UK (Birmingham/Glasgow). 🇬🇧

💡 **What are / will you be working on?**

</aside>

I’m still getting to grips with the Backend team’s deliverables. I know we have the main server and the content server. I’ll be getting the main server up and running locally first, then moving onto the content server next week.

My greatest love is food🍱, especially here in Taiwan! I’m always excited to try new things, the more culturally interesting the better. I love anything super Taiwanese (鹹豆漿，臭豆腐，牛肉麵什麼的), but I also haven’t found any cuisine I don’t like yet, so whatever you’re excited for invite me along!

I also enjoy exercise, though I am mainly motivated by the fact that I’ll be able to eat more if I burn more calories 😅. I love cycling🚲, jogging🏃 and swimming🏊. Squash(壁球) is great fun, though in Taiwan I feel like I should switch to Badminton🏸, and obviously hiking here is a dream. If you’ve got any such plans I’d love to join in!

Other than that I love playing video games and studying Mandarin. Recently I’ve been combining the two, playing games like Pokemon or Persona 5 in Mandarin. I strongly believe that video games are an incredibly exciting artistic medium with the power to tell stories like no other medium can, and we’re still in the early stages of discovering what is possible.

💪🏻 **“You can lean on me to…”** List your strengths here! What can your teammates lean on you for?

</aside>

My biggest strength has always been my enthusiasm. I’m quite naturally optimistic and quick to find joy in any situation, and when I have a dream I can be very persistent in how I pursue it.

I am also a fast learner. I can make connections between concepts quickly, which has helped me in my Mandarin journey just as much as it has in my professional career. When planning out a new feature I’m good at assessing the potential pros and cons and I can spot early when something isn’t panning out as expected.

I don’t have a favourite season, I love the contrast between them. Back in the UK the first day when I left school or work and the sun had already set, the city was already cold and rainy and all the lights were on always made me super excited because it meant the start to the cozy season of jumpers and mulled wine, but then the first day when it was nice enough outside to have a picnic in the park with friends was equally as wonderful.

My perfect day would start with a beautiful cycle ride and end with great food shared with friends. That’s why I love 淡水 so much, the cycle path from Taipei to 淡水 is gorgeous, and the food and the vibes in 淡水 are amazing, so it is the perfect place for a day trip!

An accomplishment I’m particularly proud of is landing this job, actually😅, and the Mandarin study that made it possible. I’ve had my heart set on living in Taiwan for three years now and have had to overcome some really difficult challenges along the way, but now I’ve got a great new job, a fab new apartment, and a life where I’m switching between English and Mandarin every day!
