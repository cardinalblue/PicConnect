**Introduce yourself**

Hi! I’m from the UK and have lived in Taiwan for nearly 5 years now. My name is Alice - pronounced the usual way - my Chinese name is 譚艾莉 so you can try that too! (Though my Chinese is always a WIP)

**Which function and efforts are you in?**

I’m a Marketing Specialist in the PicCollage Effort

**What are you currently working on?**

I’m currently working on taking over the PicCollage instagram account, as well as other social media things and becoming the go to native-English copywriter for UX/UI/anywhere you need copy. Also - self appointed British culture / bird specialist.

**Who are you outside of work?**

I want to be on a mountain! Usually via bike, rain or shine.

I run a small business based in the UK called ‘Birds in Hats’ so some weekends are spent painting new designs or scheming new products.

**“You can lean on me to…”**

My degree is in Creative Writing. I love to write and to discuss the intricacies of the (sometimes frustrating) language we call English. Please ask me anything! I also have a lot of experience running my own creative business so am happy to discuss side hustles and ideas of any kind.

I also know a *lot* about birds - here for anyone who wants to enter the world of birdwatching ;)

- **My perfect day would start with _____ and end with _____**

My perfect day would start with a 5am bike ride to the top of Maokong - to have coffee with the monkeys. It would end back in Taipei with sushi and an Old Fashioned with friends.

- **My favourite comfort food is…**

My favourite comfort food is 蔥抓餅 - with basil, cheese and egg - from the Yongkang St vendor. Forever.

- **“My dream home would be…”**

A (fancy) treehouse near the mountains and the ocean!
