⛰️ **Hobbies and Interests**

I enjoy **dancing** 💃,  playing **darts** 🎯, playing **pool** 🎱, playing **table tennis** 🏓~
Lately, I’ve been learning how to ride the **bike** 🚴‍♀️, **swim** 🏊‍♀️, and **rock climb** 🧗‍♀️

---

I’ve recently picked up the **ukulele** and once I’ve mastered it, I aim to move onto the **classical guitar**🎵

I enjoy all forms of art from **drawing**, **painting**, **crafting** 🎨, to writing **poetry**, **songs**, **raps** 🎤, and simply **singing** and **dancing** 🎶!
Last year, I took a two-part **fashion design** course at 實踐大學 as well~

I’ve mainly been focused on honing my **public speaking** and **communication** skills 📢 by taking Vinh Giang’s STAGE Masterclass.

I’ve also been learning **Japanese** 🇯🇵 and **French** 🇫🇷, and have been constantly working on my **台語 Taiwanese** 🇹🇼!

I’m forever and always working on my **cooking** and **baking**! 👩‍🍳

> TL;DR: If you have any advice on **ukulele**, would like to play some **table tennis**, could speak to me using **台語,** or are interested in anything else from above, let’s link up!

💪🏻 **“You can lean on me to…”**

</aside>

- **Be Incredibly Thorough With A Task**
    - I can choose to hyper-fixate on certain things
        - pros: I will do a really thorough and detailed job on any task you hand me
        - cons: I’ll very much be in my *zone* to which I might become an anti-social hermit crab 🦀 - I might even forget how to breathe 🫢
- **Break The Ice**
    - I took theater in High School and improv class has turned me into a *bit* of a theater kid
        - pros: I can choose to be outgoing and turn into an “energy panda” 🐼 as coined by a good friend
        - cons: I will become an anti-social hermit crab if done for too long of a period of time 🫠, or if I don’t take enough breaks in-between performing such a task
- **Problem Solve in Creative Ways**
    - Many of my friends would say I have quite a unique brain
        - pros: I often think of unique solutions to problems that may even seem unsolvable
        - cons: You might think my brain is weird and you wouldn’t be wrong 🧠

⁉️ **Fun Questions 🥳**

</aside>

- Do you collect anything?
    - I love collecting **stickers**!
    All sorts of cute, sparkly, pretty, squishy, glittery, funny, meme-y stickers
- Right now, I’m reading about….
    - The human immune system 😂
    The book **Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive** by Kurzgesagt. I’ve been reading it since mid-Covid; it’s a pretty big book and also one of those books that you pick up every once in a while.
- Before I started my career at PicCollage, would you believe I was a…
    - Small **Twitch Affiliate Streamer**.
    For a short period of a couple months, I amassed around 600+ followers on Twitch, getting to the Affiliate level, streaming a mobile-app game called **Brawl Stars**
    I *might* stream again someday, but I *still play* the game, so hit me up if you’re down to play!
- *Bonus: My favourite comfort food is… CHAWANMUSHI.*

💡 **What I’m Currently And Will Be Working On**

</aside>

With this internship, I’m focused on gaining corporate experience before I continue to finish my Bachelor’s degree that I started at the University of Washington, Seattle (open to finishing the degree elsewhere) at some point within the next 10 years.

Currently, I have my goals set on becoming an Early Childhood Education teacher, ideally teaching English or Art to the kids of Taiwan, but who’s to say how my goals might change after some months at PicCollage 🤷🏻‍♀️

***If you’ve made it to here, I just wanted to thank you for reading some if not all of what I had to share, and I hope to make your acquaintance 🥰***
