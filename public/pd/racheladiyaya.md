👋🏻 **Introduce yourself:** Where are you from, how to pronounce your name, how would you like to be called?

</aside>

I prefer to be called Rachel back in my city, Surabaya, Indonesia. However, since I moved to Singapore and now Taiwan, some people also call me by my family name, Adiyaya, because they think it’s cute(tho my professor just can’t pronounce my first name). You can pronounce my name rei-chel or ra-sel if you find the first one too hard!

One thing I cannot live without is dogs. A fun fact: I was afraid of dogs until I was 13 years old, which is when I first got Cherry as my first pet. In fact, I opposed the idea of having dogs in my house, but well, look at me now. All I want now is to be rich enough to establish a dog shelter, or at least to help in rescuing dogs in the future!

The best advice I ever received was God has a plan for us. I know it seems silly to most, but I believe that everything happens for a reason. Whether, it is something simple like meeting new friends, or something big like getting a new job, rejected for university, it will all somehow work according to what He wants. This makes me feel I should just give my best and let God do the rest, so it is less stressful for me.
