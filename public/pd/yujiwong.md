# Yuji Wong

Title: Android Developer
Short Name: Yuji
中文名字: 翁有志
Function: Dev (Android)
Active: Yes

Hi, I am Yuji, which is my Chinese name pronounced in Taiwanese. If your grandparents love to watch the local TV drama shows, you may be familiar with my name because they named the same one for the characters many times. 🤦🏻‍♂️

I grow up in Keelung. It is a rainy city, so there is always an umbrella in my bag. But, umbrella is just a symbol. We don’t use it actually.

I have a cat. 🐈
