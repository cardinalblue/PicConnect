## Bio

- **Introduce yourself**

Hi I’m Naomi* pronounced: “Nay-Oh-Me” with a long “a,” not Nigh-Oh-Me with a long “i.” I’m from the USA and have lived most of my adult life in NYC until I moved to Taiwan in 2012 for a job.

- **Which function and efforts are you in? What are you currently working on?**

I’m a proud member of Visual Design and I’m working on a branding project for company effort. Sometimes I work with reach.

- **Who are you outside of work?**

Outside of work I like to bake, cook, exercise (hiit, weights, crossfit, cycling) and watch movies/tv. I love hiking. Once the killer hornets calm down I’d love to go on more hikes with my PicCollage people.

- **“You can lean on me to…”**

I have good knowledge of print and manufacturing which so far isn’t very useful at a software company

. Feel free to ask.

**Fun Fact(s)**

- Some people might be surprised to learn that I used to cook professionally and had a restaurant and catering business. I also have 2 aquatic turtles, 6 years old, named Basil and Romaine.
- My name, Naomi, is from the old testament of the bible, so it’s a very OLD name. I think it’s cool that Japanese people also have a similar name so it won’t bother me if you call me “Now-Me.”
