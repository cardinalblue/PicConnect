## Bio

**Introduce yourself**

- Hello everyone, I’m Aaron, and I’m from Taipei. My Chinese name is 倪僑德, spelled as Ni Chiao-Te and pronounced as Ni Chout-The. You can call me Chiao-Te / Aaron / Ni. Some of my friends call me NiNi because they think it’s cute. So you are also welcome to call me that if you don’t feel it’s too weird.

**Which function and efforts are you in?**

- I am in the iOS function and work on PicCollage efforts.

**Who are you outside of work?**

- I love traveling to different cities such as Kyoto and seeing the local architecture. I also have a few restaurants on my bucket list that I would love to visit, such as a Sanxi resturant that sells fried milk tofu! And also, I’m a one-year-old baby’s dad. So if anyone would like to share your experience about being a dad, I would be glad to chat.

**“You can lean on me to….”**

- I am a good listener and love hearing people’s stories, whether that would be about travel, hobbies or something new you are learning! I’m interested in learning about new things, such as art, culture and technology. I also enjoy the challenge of acquiring a new skill. I used to read a lot when I had more free time, so if you are interested in reading Mandarin books, maybe I can recommend some. My favorite author is 朱少麟. She has only written 3 books but they are all amazing.

**Fun fact(s):**

**“One thing I cannot live without is….”**

- Coffee and sugar, but don’t mix them, please.

**“My dream home would be….”**

- With a huge French window and a great view. I need sunlight XD.

**“An accomplishment I’m particularly proud of is….”**

- My son walked a few steps last week.

**“What is your favorite season and why?”**

- I love fall and winter because it’s not too hot.

**“I am superstitious about ___.”**

- I am superstitious about Feng shui. I like it because it’s not just superstition and part of Chinese culture in my opinion, but also some rules to make a safe and not stressful environment for people.
