## Bio

- **Introduce yourself**

My name, Naga, is an amphibious race in the Warcraft series, which I loved playing so much when I was in junior high school. This word is probably originated from the [Indian religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga). (Thanks Vinay!)

I’m from Hsinchu County, a lovely place to live but lack of entertainment.
