Introduce yourself:

```
I was born in Taipei, but moved to China when I was about 3 years old because of my family's business. We do always came back to Taiwan during my summer and winter vacation, and that was my favorite time of the year!

My Mandarin name is 子心 [Tzu-Hsin], and the name originated from the idiom "赤子之心". My parents gave me this name because they wanted me to stay pure at heart, be kind, and do good for the society.

I usually went by my English name Kelsy [Kel-sie], which I believed was a name from an English textbook, but I love it.
```

Which function and efforts are you in?

```
I'm in the User Research team under Community function and PCR effort (I hope I got the terms right....)

```

What are you currently working on?

```
I'm currently working hard to get familiar with PicCollage's different meetings, projects that needs UR team's assistance, and also brainstorm on how to help UR expand its participants pool organically.

```

Who are you outside of work?

```
I'm recently really into a MMORPG game called Final Fantasy XIV because I can hang out, complete missions, and run dungeons with my partner as we don't see each other often. I also like to explore new things (but that doesn't mean I'm good at it!), like aerial yoga, standUp paddle-boarding, ATV rides, air pistols, you name it. Lately, I'm trying to get into Swing dancing and have planned to join several upcoming events.

```

“You can lean on me to…”

```
I'm a very action-oriented person, so when I made up my mind that I wanted to do something, I will always give in my full commitment.
