**Introduce Yourself**

Hi! I’m Hamish (hay-mish). Born and raised in New Zealand, I moved to the US for around 10 years initially for school but then I stayed. My partner and I moved to Taiwan in 2022, traveling around the island for a bit before settling down in Taipei.

**Which function and efforts are you in?**

I’m leading the USERs function and working as part of the User Research team.

**What are you currently working on?**

**Who are you outside of work?**

Planning some research to help us better understand the motivations and personalities of some of our core user groups

I love building and making stuff! Furniture, electronics, baking, cooking, weaving, carving, all kinds of stuff. I also play (soccer) and watch (baseball, cricket) a lot of sports, and am learning to surf.

*Night Of the Living Rez*, if you have any book recs let me know, always looking for the next read

**What are your hidden talents?**

I bake a great birthday cake. And can identify and forage most kinds of edible mushroom.

**My favourite comfort food is…**

Sweets, I have a huge sweet tooth. Coffee, love a good cappucino. Dumplings of all shapes and sizes. And Hot Pot, always where I go when I want to celebrate.
