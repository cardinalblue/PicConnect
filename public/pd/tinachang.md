👋🏻 **Introduce yourself:** Where are you from, how to pronounce your name, how would you like to be called?

</aside>

Hello! I’m Tina (Tee-nah), and I’m from Taiwan!

<aside>
💼 **Which Function and Efforts are you in?**

</aside>

I’ll be joining the marketing team as an intern :)

<aside>
💡 **What are / will you be working on?**

</aside>

I’m unsure yet, but from what I’ve been told it seems like a variety of tasks so I’m really excited to learn from each one!

<aside>
⛰️ **Who are you outside of work?** This could include things like your hobbies and interests

</aside>

I love trying out cozy hobbies like crocheting/knitting (though how good I am at either one is up for debate…), I also love to unwind with games like Stardew Valley, Unpacking, and A Little to the Left! I like to explore the city for new cafe’s, small trinket shops, and independent bookstores too :)

<aside>
💪🏻 **“You can lean on me to…”** List your strengths here! What can your teammates lean on you for?

</aside>

- get something done on schedule/by its deadline
- create a schedule/timeline for a project (but also make it look very nice so it doesn’t seem like a chore to look at it)
- bring new ideas/suggestions to the table - i’m always scrolling a number of different social media platforms (a habit i failed to break 🥲) and try to note down anything particularly interesting or if there seems to be a new growing trend on a specific platform
- pay attention to detail - i try to be as thorough as i can both in the process of carrying out a task, but also in reviewing the work i’ve done (but i still make sure i’m not wasting time doing unnecessary tweaks/edits!)
- make a tiresome task seem less so! i love to complete tasks while doing something fun at the same time (going for a coffee run, discussing something while on a walk, finishing up something over snacks and chitchat)
- just be someone you can talk to in general! i love to listen and i’m always down to discuss something with you, whether it be work- or personal life-related
- (use a lot of exclamation marks, made apparent to myself while writing all of this)
