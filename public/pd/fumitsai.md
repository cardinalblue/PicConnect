### I love mountains! ⛰️

If someone ask me “Beach or mountain?” I will definitely answer “Mountain!”

I love fresh air and beautiful scenery there and they make me feel alive!  

### I enjoy hand drip coffee ☕

I started with convenience store coffee and single-origin drip bags. And then, by chance, I developed a passion for hand-dripped coffee. 

I especially enjoy light roast coffee, which retains sweet and sour notes similar to fresh flowers and fruits.

### I love Japanese Anime music! 🎵

One of my hobbies is listening to Japanese songs. I believe the greatest composer in the world is Yuki Kajiura, the most talented singing singer is Chiaki Ishikawa, and the best music groups are See-Saw and Kalafina!

By the way, I regularly go to Japanese karaoke with friends.
