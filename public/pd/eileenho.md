👋🏻 **Introduce yourself:** Where are you from, how to pronounce your name, how would you like to be called?

I’m Eileen (eye-lean)! I was born and raised in the US (Northern Virginia → Bay Area → Taiwan) and moved to Taiwan 2.5 years ago. My mom was Taiwanese and we would visit her side of the family for a few summers when I was growing up. Moving here full-time has been completely different from visiting, and I am loving every minute of it!

I’m an athlete, musician, and mom of 2.

I used to be a serious rock climber (climbed for 15 years, mostly bouldering). I’m now training for my first bodybuilding competition (bikini). I love participating in all sorts of fitness - I am always down for dance classes (heels, hip hop, pole), yoga, HIIT, etc. Last year I did a Spartan Race and a triathlon. Hoping to do hyrox next year after my bikini competition! I am average at best at all of these sports, I just like participating 😀

I play piano, guitar, and sing. I dreamt of being a rock star when I was young, but I had typical Asian parents who forced me to practice classical piano for 10 years and then balked at the idea of me being a full-time musician. I’m always up for a jam session!

I have a 3 year old boy (Bean - name after the kid in Ender’s game) and a 1 year old girl, Coco. Bean has been obsessed with cars ever since he was 6 months old and Coco mostly just loves her rabbit blanket.

- “An accomplishment I’m particularly proud of is….” Becoming a software engineer! I used to be a teacher with zero CS experience or knowledge, and sometimes I still can’t believe I was able to make the career change the way that I did.
- My favourite comfort food is…french fries. All time favorite is Five Guys cajun fries (the original store is near where I grew up). These fries are my go-to for celebrating milestones, when I’m having a terrible day, or just plain hungry. I prefer to go eat them alone because I don’t like the pressure of sharing the fries.
