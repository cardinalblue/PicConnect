### Hi there!

I’m Rina from Indonesia. I came here for studying, but in the end I like Taiwan a lot that I’ve decided to work here.

### **Which Function and Efforts are you in?**

I’m in MLAD function. For the efforts, I guess it’s whichever needed an effect… (?) xD

### **What are / will you be working on?**

Currently developing slideshow effect for PicCollage Android

### **Who are you outside of work?**

I’d like to think that I’m an artist in training, as I’m currently taking art classes xD. I like to try out different DIYs too (e.g. flower arrangements, pottery, etc). I also love to drink tea and sometimes I go to teahouses to wind down.

### **“You can lean on me to…”**

My friends said that I’m a good listener, so.. I guess that..? 🤣 
I’ll also love to help in illustrating or drawing some stuffs (not people’s faces tho)

### Fun facts

- I’m practically addicted to **TEA!**
- I collect postcards.
- I like raccoons, they're funny.
- I listen to true crime podcasts.
