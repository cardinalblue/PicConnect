🌎 **My Background…**

</aside>

<aside>
💼 **What I do at work…**

</aside>

I come from a very small village in the south-west of England and from an early age did what I could to leave! I studied foreign languages at college (French & German) and spent time living in both those countries, lapping up the culture and diversity. Finally, I moved to Taiwan and found my second home here. I am a teacher by trade and so it’s no surprise I found myself at age 37 specialising in organisational learning and development. Once a teacher, always a teacher! 

At work, I spend most of my time supporting the Company Effort. I work in People Operations but, from time to time, get involved in Company Operations projects, too! The work I do is fairly varied from facilitating projects, hosting InnoFest and Workshop Day to reviewing our performance management systems and professional development initiatives.

💬 **My communication style…**

🗣 **How I like to give & get feedback…**

</aside>

I can be pretty indirect and long-winded so please do tell me to cut to the chase if I haven’t yet made my point. That said, I aspire to be empathetic and a good listener. Although I am more introverted and need lots of rest after hosting a big event, I’ve been told I am quite engaging, and very confident! That’s news to me as inside I’m typically pretty anxious. I often spend too much time writing or crafting messages, overthinking every word. However, with that comes some clarity in what I am trying to communicate (hopefully…).

When it comes to feedback, I like it regular and balanced. More recently, I’ve taken to the Netlfix approach: Make it Aim-to Assist and make it Actionable. 

I see feedback as a conversation, and try to reserve judgement. For me, feedback is about developing more self and other awareness and moving more of your hidden self into the open (see Johari Window).

🤝 **My ideal meeting or discussion…**

</aside>

If I could design my ideal meeting, it would start… on time 🫠 but I am learning let go of being so time focussed. That said, the agenda would be clear and concise, and everyone feel prepared (and have done some homework…). I like outcomes but then, that depends on the mode of the meeting. Documentation is key… mainly because I have a terrible short term memory but also, we don’t wanna lose the gold we just came up with. Most importantly, everyone would feel safe to speak up and share their ideas. Everyone would be valued for their contributions. 

<aside>
♉ **Personality type: ENTP…**

</aside>

While I don’t fully subscribe to the whole personality test thing, here’s my result: 

ENTPs are inspired innovators, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually challenging problems. They are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. Open-minded and unconventional, Visionaries want to analyze, understand, and influence other people.

If I could live up to half of the above, I’d be doing very well I think 🤣

👍 **Things I’m good at…**

🆘 **Things I’ll need your help with…**

</aside>

There are a few things you can always count on me for at work. I’d say first it would be facilitation skills. If there's a meeting / workshop coming up that you’d like some help with, I’d happily prep with you. I enjoy planning and hosting meetings - I think both of these skills come from my time teaching and planning classes. No matter how nervous I might be feeling on the inside, I do my best to cover that up or share that feeling if I am comfortable with the people around me. I try to pretty well-organized (most of the time) and can adjust to most environments pretty quickly. Whether it's managing a complex project or simply keeping track of my own to-do list. 

I can't think on my feet too quickly so I need time to think things through so if you can give me the agenda or reading material ahead of time, I’ll definitely do my research. 

I'm not a tech expert so sometimes lack understanding of the work of my colleagues but I’ve been doing a few short courses here and there to learn more about AI or Python for example. 

I overthink and over plan which can slow things down. I am trying to be more MVP. Do let me know if you think I’ve gone too far and there’s an easier way to get something going. 

I lack confidence in myself and my own value so sometimes I take a back seat in conversations and don't stand my ground in discussions. I suppose you could help bring me into conversations sometimes or let me know if I am on the right track.
